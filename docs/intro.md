# Forensics Documentation

Welcome to the Forensics documentation! This documentation is structured to mirror the actual project structure, making it easy to find information about specific parts of the application.

## Project Overview

Forensics let's you analyze your codebases. At the moment you can analyze Java projects (Maven & Gradle) but more languages are to follow.

### Java

- Package Analyzer: Graph Visualization of packages & dependencies
- Sequence Diagram Visualization of app flow

## Technology Stack

- Visualizations based on Cytoscape.js & Mermaid
- Next.js 15 (TypeScript)
- Functional Programming with fp-ts
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Component-based architecture
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Comprehensive testing setup

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to match the project structure:

- [Project Structure](/docs/project)
- [Environment](/docs/environment)
- [Testing](/docs/testing)

## Prerequisites
