# Testing

This document outlines how to test the Forensics project.

## Where to write the tests?

The tests are located at `test/` and the content follows the structure found in `src/`, the test files end with `.spec.ts`.

## How to test?

We're using the integrated test features available since Node.js v18. The `examples/` directory is used for testing purposes and will be extended and better structured soon.
